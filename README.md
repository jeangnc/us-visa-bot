# US Visa Bot ü§ñ

An automated bot that monitors and reschedules US visa interview appointments to get you an earlier date.

## Features

- üîÑ Continuously monitors available appointment slots
- üìÖ Automatically books earlier dates when found  
- üéØ Configurable target and minimum date constraints
- üö® Exits successfully when target date is reached
- üìä Detailed logging with timestamps
- üîê Secure authentication with environment variables

## How It Works

The bot logs into your account on https://ais.usvisa-info.com/ and checks for available appointment dates every few seconds. When it finds a date earlier than your current booking (and within your specified constraints), it automatically reschedules your appointment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- A valid US visa interview appointment
- Access to https://ais.usvisa-info.com/

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/us-visa-bot.git
cd us-visa-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```env
EMAIL=your.email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_password
COUNTRY_CODE=your_country_code
SCHEDULE_ID=your_schedule_id
FACILITY_ID=your_facility_id
REFRESH_DELAY=3
```

### Finding Your Configuration Values

| Variable | Description | How to Find |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `EMAIL` | Your login email | Your credentials for ais.usvisa-info.com |
| `PASSWORD` | Your login password | Your credentials for ais.usvisa-info.com |
| `COUNTRY_CODE` | Your country code | Found in URL: `https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-{COUNTRY_CODE}/` <br>Examples: `br` (Brazil), `fr` (France), `de` (Germany) |
| `SCHEDULE_ID` | Your appointment schedule ID | Found in URL when rescheduling: <br>`https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-{COUNTRY_CODE}/niv/schedule/{SCHEDULE_ID}/continue_actions` |
| `FACILITY_ID` | Your consulate facility ID | Found in network calls when selecting dates, or inspect the date selector dropdown <br>Example: Paris = `44` |
| `REFRESH_DELAY` | Seconds between checks | Optional, defaults to 3 seconds |

## Usage

Run the bot with your current appointment date:

```bash
node index.js -c <current_date> [-t <target_date>] [-m <min_date>]
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Flag | Long Form | Required | Description |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `-c` | `--current` | ‚úÖ | Your current booked interview date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `-t` | `--target` | ‚ùå | Target date to stop at - exits successfully when reached |
| `-m` | `--min` | ‚ùå | Minimum acceptable date - skips dates before this |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage - reschedule to any earlier date
node index.js -c 2023-06-15

# With target date - stop when you get June 1st or earlier  
node index.js -c 2023-06-15 -t 2023-06-01

# With minimum date - only accept dates after May 1st
node index.js -c 2023-06-15 -m 2023-05-01

# With both constraints - only book between May 1st and June 1st
node index.js -c 2023-06-15 -t 2023-06-01 -m 2023-05-01

# Get help
node index.js --help
```

## How It Behaves

The bot will:
1. **Log in** to your account using provided credentials
2. **Check** for available dates every few seconds
3. **Compare** found dates against your constraints:
   - Must be earlier than current date (`-c`)
   - Must be after minimum date (`-m`) if specified
   - Will exit successfully if target date (`-t`) is reached
4. **Book** the appointment automatically if conditions are met
5. **Continue** monitoring until target is reached or manually stopped
